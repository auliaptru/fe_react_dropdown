# Dropdown with ReactJS and Vite

This TV page is my eleventh day of doing a 50 Day Challenge to code using React JS! I'm also using Vite and Sass in this code.

This dropdown can use keyboard keys to scroll data with arrow up and down, backspace for delete in search input, and enter to select data.
